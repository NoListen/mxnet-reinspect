If you trained one model, put these two files in the directory [Reinspect](https://github.com/Russell91/reinspect).

```
python just_XXX.py --weights model.caffemodel --config config.json
```

You can get one caffemodel containing only GoogleNet's part and one lstm.h5 containing only the latter lstm part.
